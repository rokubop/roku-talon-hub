# Roku Talon Hub

Welcome! Below are my shared Talon voice tools, games, and utilities. Many of these are experimental. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out on the [Talon Slack](https://talonvoice.com/chat)

## Talon Tools

### [Talon UI Elements](https://github.com/rokubop/talon-ui-elements)

A talon UI library for building stateful and interactive voice activated canvases using an HTML/CSS/React-inspired syntax for python

### [Parrot mode v6 - 14 noises](https://github.com/rokubop/parrot_mode_14_noise_v6)

Parrot Mode v6 - 14 noises is a mode where only noises are active, toggled on and off by one dedicated noise. Assumes a 14 noise parrot model with talon beta. Includes actions for mouse movement, scrolling, repetition, tracking, and clicking.

### [roku-talon-shared](https://github.com/rokubop/roku-talon-shared)

Majority of my shared tools and game configs live here. Will likely be breaking these out into individual repos at some point and list them here instead.
